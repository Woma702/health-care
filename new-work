When someone helps you, it’s great to let them know that you would help them too if they were in  trouble. Say “I owe you” or “I owe you one” to let your friend know that you will repay their kindness at some point in the future.

When someone has really helped you out of a tough situation, especially by using a special skill or personality trait, you can use this expression. A star is a very special or amazing person, though, so make sure only to use this expression if you really mean it!
