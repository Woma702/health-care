When someone helps you, it’s great to let them know that you would help them too if they were in  trouble. Say “I owe you” or “I owe you one” to let your friend know that you will repay their kindness at some point in the future.

Thanks for being such a star
When someone has really helped you out of a tough situation, especially by using a special skill or personality trait, you can use this expression. A star is a very special or amazing person, though, so make sure only to use this expression if you really mean it!

This means a lot to me
When people help you, what might seem like a simple task to them could really make a big difference to you. If this is the case, remind the person how important their help was by saying “This means a lot to me.”

So, next time someone helps you out, think twice about what you will say to them and make sure to show your appreciation appropriately.
